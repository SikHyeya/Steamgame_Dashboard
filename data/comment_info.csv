This game is pure unadulterated dog shit  it's a terrible new player experience  coated with an over-abundance of gimmicky abilities and crowd control. It's like if you let a group of 12 year old's develop a competitive MOBA title.  The extreme level of different abilities and vast power-spikes can turn a fun and engaging early game experience into a god awful immune to literally everything Slark one-shotting your entire team EVEN if they're fed.  DOTA just simply does not hold up with the level of competitive integrity that other similar titles offer. The overpowered  overloaded  over-the-top skills quickly get old as you're constantly left scratching your head after the 5th team of people that all speak different languages after waiting 40 minutes to finally get a good match where someone doesn't abandon and waste all your time.  The game is not salvageable it will die. Inevitably. In the very least at least some small places in the world will keep the player count around 200k~ for a while  though once all the old folks get tired of it.. That's it.  R.I.P DOTA  I gave it a shot  it's just not worth the stress LMAO,ENG

139574702,578080,76561197972545603,9209,976,Despite being launched nearly a decade ago  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) still remains a titan in the landscape of online multiplayer first-person shooter games. This is not a happenstance. It is the result of Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment's dedication to continually refining and upgrading the game to cater to the evolving tastes of the gaming community.  CS:GO maintains the core mechanics of the original Counter-Strike that made it so popular among gamers. The game is grounded in its adherence to skill-based gunplay  strategy  and teamwork. It's a classic standoff between terrorists and counter-terrorists with a variety of maps that have become iconic in the FPS genre. Dust2  Mirage  and Inferno  among others  have hosted countless adrenaline-fueled matches that have brought both crushing defeats and exhilarating victories.  Each weapon in CS:GO feels unique  providing a distinctive rhythm and strategy to the combat. Mastering the spray pattern of the AK-47  for example  is a feat that marks a significant milestone in a player's skill progression. This  coupled with the high-stakes economy system  makes every round  every decision  and every shot matter. The sense of risk and reward is palpable and keeps players coming back for more.  However  CS:GO isn't without its downsides. Its steep learning curve may be off-putting to newcomers who may find themselves outmatched in early games. Although there are tutorial systems and offline practice modes available  they do not fully prepare a player for the intense competition that awaits in the online arena. Additionally  as is common with many online games  there can be issues with toxicity within the community  despite ongoing efforts by Valve to mitigate this problem.  The game has also innovated with its skins market  which allows players to customize their weapons with various designs  giving a unique aesthetic touch to the game. While this has no impact on gameplay  it has been wildly successful and has turned into a virtual economy on its own.  Another aspect that's worth mentioning is the eSport scene. CS:GO has one of the most established professional scenes in the world  hosting numerous tournaments with massive prize pools that have helped establish gaming as a legitimate sport. The game's competitive spirit has translated well into this arena  making it not only fun to play but also highly engaging to watch.  In conclusion  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is an enduring classic that combines skill-based gameplay with high-stakes strategy. It is a game that both adheres to its roots and evolves to keep up with contemporary gaming trends. Its few flaws are outweighed by the thrill of its combat  the depth of its strategy  and the vibrancy of its community. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newbie ready to dive into the world of first-person shooters  CS:GO offers an experience that is challenging  rewarding  and  above all  fun.

139422628,578080,76561199081826540,100790,12027,The time I spent playing this game could've been allocated to a variety of activities that could have had a positive impact on my life  such as studying  applying for jobs  building real-life friendships  nurturing relationships  spending quality time with my family  focusing on physical fitness  and striving to become a better person overall.  However  my experience with this game has been a mixed bag. On one hand  I've unfortunately acquired an extremely offensive vocabulary that includes racist and homophobic terms. On a more positive note  I unexpectedly picked up some Russian language skills along the way. However  it's important to acknowledge that this game has also contributed to anger management issues  and I've noticed tendencies that could be associated with borderline autism. Moreover  the excessive time spent gaming has led to sleep deprivation.  Despite the drawbacks  I oddly find myself inclined to give this game a perfect rating of 10/10. I'm determined to make necessary changes in my life and not uninstall it just yet. However  it's crucial for me and others to remember that practicing in Deathmatch and Casual modes  honing our cross-hair and mouse sensitivity  and being prepared before entering competitive matches can greatly improve the gaming experience for everyone involved. Let's strive for respectful and enjoyable gameplay.,ENG

140184376,578080,76561198130574459,1820,1628,[h1]How Shrek 2 made me have improvement as a CS:GO Player[/h1]  [b]Introduction:[/b] Shrek 2  directed by Andrew Adamson  is a film that holds a special place in my heart not only for its entertainment value but also for its surprising impact on my skills as a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) player. Released in 2004 as a sequel to the beloved original  this animated comedy transported me into a world of fairy tale charm and laughter. Little did I know that beneath the surface  Shrek 2 would ignite a newfound motivation and elevate my abilities in the virtual battlegrounds of CS:GO.  [b]A Lesson in Teamwork and Communication:[/b] One of the key elements that resonated with me in Shrek 2 was the film's focus on teamwork and communication. As Shrek  Donkey  and their friends embarked on their mission to save the kingdom  I witnessed firsthand the power of collaboration and effective communication. This aspect struck a chord with me  as I realized that these same principles are fundamental to success in team-based competitive games like CS:GO.  Inspired by Shrek 2  I began to prioritize effective communication with my teammates during matches. I improved my callouts  shared valuable information  and actively coordinated strategies to achieve our objectives. The film's reminder of the importance of teamwork and communication has had a profound impact on my CS:GO journey  leading to better coordination  synergy  and ultimately  more victories.  [b]Embracing Diversity and Adaptability:[/b] Shrek 2's eclectic cast of characters  from ogres to fairy tale creatures  highlights the significance of diversity and adaptability. Just like in the film  where different species and personalities had to come together for a common cause  CS:GO teams consist of individuals with distinct play styles  strengths  and weaknesses.  Taking a page from Shrek 2  I learned to appreciate the unique strengths and perspectives of my teammates. I recognized the importance of adapting my play style to complement theirs  embracing versatility and flexibility in my approach. By doing so  I discovered new strategies  synergies  and play styles that enriched my overall gameplay. Shrek 2's emphasis on diversity and adaptability became a guiding principle that helped me grow as a CS:GO player.  [b]Perseverance and Overcoming Challenges:[/b] Shrek 2 serves as a powerful reminder of the value of perseverance and overcoming challenges. Throughout the film  Shrek and his companions face numerous obstacles and setbacks. Despite the odds stacked against them  they never lose sight of their goal  exhibiting determination  resilience  and unwavering spirit.  Translating this message to CS:GO  I learned to adopt a similar mindset. Whenever I encountered difficult matches  losing streaks  or encountered formidable opponents  I channeled the spirit of Shrek and his friends. I embraced challenges as opportunities for growth  refused to give up  and focused on learning from my mistakes. Shrek 2's lessons in perseverance have not only made me a more resilient player but have also positively impacted my attitude and approach to real-life challenges.  [b]Conclusion:[/b] Shrek 2  a film cherished for its humor and fairy tale charm  unexpectedly became a catalyst for my growth as a CS:GO player. Through its lessons in teamwork  communication  diversity  adaptability  perseverance  and overcoming challenges  the film inspired me to become a better player both in-game and in life. Shrek 2's impact goes beyond its cinematic brilliance  and I am grateful for the valuable lessons it imparted on my CS:GO journey.,ENG

Climbing through the ranks requires dedication  practice  and a solid strategy. The large player base and active community ensure that there's always someone to play against  no matter the time of day.  Another aspect that makes CS:GO a timeless classic is the wide variety of weapons and equipment that players can utilize. From classic firearms like the AK-47 and M4A1 to specialized weapons like the AWP and Desert Eagle  there's a broad range of choices that allow players to customize their playstyle. Additionally  there's a vast array of skins and cosmetic items that players can use to give their weapons and characters a personal touch.  Visually  CS:GO is impressive. The game has undergone graphical improvements over the years and now offers detailed environments  realistic weapon models  and beautiful lighting. The performance is also remarkable  and even older computers can run the game relatively smoothly.

140412139,578080,76561197983358997,5431,521," New World: A Promising Game Marred by Unfair Bans and Unhelpful Support  I recently had the opportunity to delve into the immersive world of New World  and I must admit that the game initially captivated me with its engaging game play mechanics  enjoyable fishing activities  and stunning graphics. However  despite my initial enthusiasm  I cannot  in good conscience  recommend this game due to the unjust ban I received  the toxic community  and the disappointing support experience I encountered.  Firstly  let me begin by highlighting the positive aspects of New World. The game play mechanics are solid  providing a satisfying mix of exploration  combat  and progression. The fishing feature  in particular  stood out as a relaxing and enjoyable pastime  allowing players to unwind and appreciate the game's detailed environments. Additionally  the graphics are undeniably impressive  showcasing the game world's beauty with stunning visual effects.  Unfortunately  my positive experience came to an abrupt halt when I was randomly banned from the game for allegedly using a ""known cheating program."" To my bewilderment  there was no explanation provided for this ban  despite using only my regular computer programs during game play. What compounded my frustration was the discovery that many other players had encountered similar issues  facing bans without any concrete evidence or explanation.  Venturing into the New World community in search of answers  I was disheartened to find a toxic atmosphere rife with individuals blindly defending the game's anti-cheat system  insisting that it could never make mistakes. This lack of empathy and understanding from the community only served to exacerbate my frustration and sense of injustice.  Turning to the game's support for assistance  I had hoped for a resolution to my predicament. However  my experience with the support team proved to be deeply unsatisfactory. After submitting a ticket detailing my ban and providing the necessary information  I received a copy-pasted email response within a mere 30 minutes. To my dismay  the reply simply stated that my ban would not be lifted  offering no clarification or opportunity for further dialogue. It was clear that my case had not been adequately reviewed  leaving me feeling dismissed and unheard.  Regrettably  despite the many positives that New World has to offer  my ban and subsequent disappointing interactions with both the community and support team have left me with no choice but to strongly discourage others from investing their time and money into this game. While it has great potential  the unfair banning practices  toxic community  and unsupportive customer service overshadow the positive aspects of the game  leading to an overall unsatisfactory experience.  I sincerely hope that Amazon Games Studios addresses these issues promptly  as New World has the potential to become a truly remarkable MMO. Until then  I urge everyone to exercise caution and consider the risks associated with investing their time and resources into a game that may not provide the fair and enjoyable experience it promises.",ENG
139408450,578080,76561198047747985,85224,0,I just got perma banned after well over 1400 hours of gameplay for RMT selling  WHICH I HAVE NEVER DONE. I loved this game but cannot in good conscious recommend a game that will boot its paying players without warning (I bought skins & official boosters regularly). I am genuinely heartbroken.,ENG
139560740,578080,76561198167613087,28045,0,This game has a great core but is marred with many flaws. My earnest review would be mixed  but I decided on the recommend as the devs have been making a genuine attempt at improving the game and making real progress.  In my personal opinion this game shines the most for two playerbases: casuals and pvpers. New world is a great casual experience with its gorgeous open world  flexible build options (as it pertains to casual play; this is less true considering other content for reasons I will discuss) and fun  easy to learn action combat. Many of the issues new world has pertains to the post-level cap experience so casuals are largely unhindered by these flaws - you can see this come into play as the usual first impressions of new world are generally very positive  then decline as players become aware of the faults at play.  The other group this game is good for is pvp'ers. Even though I think this game could have REALLY shined here if they focused more on small scale pvp and didn't make certain changes they made to the combat back in the beta  I think it still rewards skill - you tend to see results if you put time and effort into learning how to play your builds properly  and learn how to counter or play around other builds. Pvp balance is honestly not too bad; the most fun pvp-related activities IMO are open world forts  3v3 arenas  and duels.  As for issues with the game  I will list the most important ones off the top of my head:  1) Gear is prohibitive. There are too many bad perks on gear  PvP-exclusive and PvE-exclusive perks can appear on the same item  and acquiring BiS gear is completely rng through either raw drops or crafting. You have well over 100 perks in the game  so rolling 3 desired perks on a single piece of gear is highly unlikely. This is the main reason I get burnt out of the game and drop it for a while  personally. I come back because I genuinely enjoy this game's combat but I loathe how hard it is to get great gear.  2) PvE endgame is sort of gatekept. Mutation dungeon runs have a weekly cap for runs and rewards are tied to a rank you recieve at the end of the dungeon  which naturally leads to PvE groups requiring you to run meta builds and already have good gear. It becomes much worse when you realize you're usually expected to run ward gear.   Dungeon mutations are a weekly rotation and you need different ward perks for different dungeons  which  in total  means you need 6 different ward sets if you want to be able to run mutation dungeons every week. Mutations themselves also inherently gatekeep and slow people down  as mutations scale from m1 to m10. The rewards for anything up until m10 runs are paltry at best  but you need to complete all preceding mutations to access m10's. As most people who are active PvE'rs are already running m10's and there isn't a huge influx of new players currently  preceding mutation levels are barren and take a very long time to form groups for.  The end result of this is the main endgame PvE we currently have timegates your ability to make bothering with it actually worth your time behind finding groups and the weekly cap  and when you do get access to m10's you are expected to find or buy ward equipment with the 0 coin you made doing the preceding mutations lol  3) The main pvp modes are half baked. The modes in question are outpost rush (OPR) and wars. OPR is your main casual medium-scale (20v20) game mode. It's also the only casual pvp mode that is rewarding in a meaningful capacity. It's a single map where the primary goal is capture points and keep them until either team reaches a score of 1000 points first. There is also a boss that spawns periodically that  when killed  makes the enemy team unable to gain points for a few minutes. The main problem with this game mode is there is neither matchmaking to differentiate solo queue players from premade groups nor a role function to ensure you have the resources you need to actually have a chance to win (this being bruisers and healers). The end result is many OPR games result in landslide victories - most people who solo queue run with ranged builds so they can actually get kills and not die on cooldown from zergs  but the consequence is they're not that useful by themselves for capturing points.  Wars are also very flawed. Wars are a large scale game mode (50v50). The basic concept of a war is companies can dispute ownership of a territory by declaring war and the territory will transfer ownership to whoever wins said war. Owning a territory means you can collect taxes from people using crafting stations and trading posts in that territory  which generates an absolute ludicrous amount of money compared to literally any other activity in the game and it's not even remotely close (basically  this means this is the sweatiest content in the game).   I can't talk as much about wars because I only ever participated in 1 war since the beta but they are very prohibitive. Companies have no cap on the amount of territories they own so the vast majority of the time the top 3 or so companies on any given server will own all territories at all times. The consequence of this is the top companies on the server get vastly more wealthy than anyone else which allows them to gear people up with BiS gear  which takes a very long time to for one person under normal circumstances let alone >50. This content basically doesn't exist for >90% of the server which is a shame.  ...  With this being said though  season 2 is looking hopeful with some very welcome additions on the way like more accessible gearing  transmog and so forth. If you enjoy pvp just to pvp or just want to chill out  kill and collect stuff in a beautiful open world for a couple dozen hours I'd say the game is already worth your time. Otherwise  I would wait and see how much season 2 fixes things if at all and determine if the game is in a good enough state to try out or not.,ENG

There is just so much to do what with the gathering  crafting and pvp options.  I find it very nice that when you don't want to pvp at all you just don't flag for pvp and then you are not bothered as you go about your day  it's just another thing to do when you are in the mood.,ENG

Mechanically this game feels good but its completely devoid of atmosphere  it looks decent but generic and suffers from poor optimization  the writing and voice acting are cringe worthy  the story is forgettable  character development and itemization is simplistic and boring  its crafting system is pointless  and player interaction is unmemorable.

140154519,578080,76561197996716675,5410,0,"90 hours in and this is my two cents:  Combat is objectively fun. It's fluid  there's some fun skills to use and it's fast paced. No standing still and waiting for your character to queue up a skill. Albeit if you get ganged up on by anything  you are gonna go down pretty much instantly.  PVP is bad. Especially for new players. If you aren't slotted with top tier gems and gear bonuses  don't bother. You're going to get slaughtered in two hits from anyone who has been playing for a long time. Severely favoring ranged DPS spam or melee stun locks  no in between. That's it. Either you run a really strong snipe build  or you get in the enemy's face and lock them down indefinitely as you smash their face in with your dual hammer/axe combos.  The world is beautiful  but sucks to traverse. Game needs mounts with how large the world map is. It's a crime to force people to rely on teleport pads to get around effectively. There's only a handful of dash skills and half of them are glitches (Void blade lunge + Oblivion). This game involves your classic ""kill 10 wolves"" or ""collect 5 materials"" and then having to manage which town has an Inn for you to be able to effectively get back to where you are.  All in all  it's a decent game if you're not looking to do PVP. If you prefer PVP  prepare to spend a ridiculous amount of time playing catch up  or buying your way to the top. I have more gripes with it but these are the major issues I have. It's another generic Tera-like MMO with a ridiculous gear ladder.",ENG
140852860,578080,76561199091692977,1921,0,For myself  it feels and plays “nex gen” ( for lack of a better term) The pacing I feel is a bit fast! In under 3 hours a hefty list of craft skills we’re all hitting lvl 10 and I was able to explore a bit well smoothly sailing quest to quest. Crafted a sword twice as powerful in that short time as well. Do not listen to negative reviews if they state Queues are to long HELLO?! This your First MMORPG?Cant believe Launch Day an mmo has queues   Grow up or wait two weeks to buy  IT’S TO GRINDY” Not sure what genre they believe there playing. I never got players who speed run mmo’s to get to “ENDGAME” There’re missing the entire concept of an mmo such as New World.  Advice for them  play Arcadegeddon (cool game)  an hour in you’ve unlocked all guns powers  best part you can keep running the same 3 dungeons over and overall day. New World is an mmo as it should be and WAS. A journey for us to live our second life’s . Seek out secrets become the ultimate wizard or blacksmith  heck blacksmith wizard Real estate agent of New world. Mmos have been failing  not because they stink because for some odd reason half of the players are lazy and want the game to auto lvl to cap day 1 no more of this put your time in earn your title instead of buying on deluxe version lol. This genre is all about massive  worlds begging to be explored  New World uses tons of logical skills to upgrade naturally! Use sword it lvls up chop tree  shoot fire ect.,ENG

Just hand over the next 2000 hours of your life. The community? Toxic. There are your max stack players  who hate all new players. They will talk trash  target  and verbally abuse you. The game does suspend accounts. But not its oldest players. They are allowed to run auto aim bots  threaten you. Call you names and they will NOT be repremanded. But if your account is new. They will suspend you. Effectively stealing from you the money you spent on the game in the end.,ENG

139523368,578080,76561199471051501,625,43,New World truly lives up to its name  providing MMORPG players with a fresh and exciting experience. It intelligently incorporates familiar elements from other games while selecting and enhancing essential aspects to create an improved player journey.  Here are some aspects I particularly enjoyed in the game:  - The crafting and gathering mechanics are thoroughly enjoyable. There is a limitless variety of items to gather  allowing players to harvest almost anything they come across in the world. The crafting system is extensive  enabling the creation of best-in-slot gear  although boss drops are required  adding variety to the gear farming experience. - New World adopts a no-subscription model  allowing players to enjoy the game with a one-time fee. Optional purchases are available in the in-store shop  but they are not necessary for gameplay  distinguishing it from other games with similar models. - I found that I could use my controller for most of the game  except for a few essential keyboard controls. However  this didn't affect combat  so I didn't experience the usual difficulties I face with my back issue when playing traditional MMORPGs. - The game features a vast world with diverse terrains. - There is a plethora of quests available  and earning experience points and reputation is not a problem in any zone. Although the quest variety may not be exceptional  leveling up is relatively easy unless you get sidetracked by the abundance of harvesting and crafting opportunities.  However  there are some aspects that could be improved:  - Quest types lack innovation and often consist of typical fetch quests or looting objectives found in other games. - The absence of mounts is noticeable  and while the fast travel system functions well  having a method of overland travel faster than running speed would be beneficial. - The diversity of mobs doesn't seem to be extensive. As a player accustomed to World of Warcraft  where encountering a wide range of different enemies is enjoyable  this may be a significant issue.  Overall  New World delivers a refreshing experience while leaving room for improvement in certain areas.,ENG

Fast forward now a massive amount of player base is using zero recoil from controllers/mice. Tons of people are using radar/wall hacks to have perfect situational awareness. Aimbot is still common. It will be the death of this game  it is already in its death rolls in the West.  I paid $60 for this game and have gotten a few thousand hours worth of mostly good times out of it and I have many fond memories from back in the day playing squads with the boys. Still have to leave a negative review again because of the cheaters which feels bad man.   The steam discussions are fun though because cheaters and Krafton employees are in a desperate fight to convince people that cheating isnt rampant. outnumbered 100 to 1 by players you gotta hand it to them for the effort o7.,ENG

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter  white sugar  brown sugar  water  cinnamon  and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil  remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips  one at a time  into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie  coating the lattice  and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.

140275643,578080,76561198085473845,74600,726,"Team Fortress 2 is one of the best games of all time  easily. Valve knocked it out of the park the way that they're known for  and the game has received numerous updates that have improved the game over the years.  However  in the current day Team Fortress 2's main mode  the online matchmaking mode known as ""Casual Mode"" has been almost completely overrun with bots who play as The Sniper class and cheat to kill players from any distance instantly. These bots make about 70%~90% of Valve's casual servers unplayable at most times of the year and most times of the day. An abandoned game overrun by bots is one thing  but the Valve corporation continues to add microtransactions to the game to this day and massively profits off of this game through that and the exchange of in-game items through the Steam Market. I feel that it is immoral the sheer amount of money that Valve makes off of Team Fortress 2 while doing nothing about the bots ruining it's most popular mode on Valve's own servers.  I love Team Fortress 2  but I cannot in good faith recommenced it to anyone as long as Valve continues to do nothing about the bots in casual mode. I really hate to see such a beloved game left to rot.",ENG

139451475,578080,76561198401712305,39855,1055,There are many more things I'd like to mention about this games strengths and what makes it unique  but I'll keep this review concise.  This game is absolutely still worth playing in 2023.  The bot crisis has pretty much been relegated to CTF servers  which is still a shame but it's much better than it being across the board. Also  community servers obviously have zero bots.  What makes me love this game is how different the experience is from any other shooter  even to this day. There are many mechanics/features that I've never seen in any other game before. I think this games biggest strength  which is also a huge factor in enabling this kind of uniqueness  is the emphasis on fun over balance and silly nature of the game which leads to more open minded devs/players.  This isn't an approach that can work for many games  but this game has had about 16 years to refine the experience and it truly shows. Despite how bizarre so many aspects of the game are  the gameplay is quite well balanced  smooth  and has a very high skill ceiling which all combine to make for a very replayable title.  Also  I'd be remissed to not talk about the elephant in the room (Overwatch) so here we go. It's a mistake to consider playing this game pointless because of the existence of Overwatch. As mentioned there are many things in this game that I've never seen in any other game before  and that includes Overwatch. These games are VERY different from each other  and each class in TF2 has much more depth than any class in Overwatch  though Overwatch does have a much larger roster. You can like one game over the other  or you could be a fan of both. They are very different games and one does not negate the others quality.,ENG

When we were going through our separation  I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage  I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this  I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage  or been one to break down and cry  but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do  I searched for a game I could play  ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit  I didn't beat the game  or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact  I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said  after doing so  I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.  After coming to that realization  I turned the game off  and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself  and I became the father I needed to be in that moment  not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today  I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight  or argue  or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents  and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is  wait for it  ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation  and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now  and are very happy together.  Moral of the story  you never know what life holds in store for you  and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me  I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.  Thank you",ENG

Over the years  the game has undergone significant evolution and expansion  setting new standards and continuously providing exciting experiences.  The Early Days: Upon its release  GTA V was hailed as a groundbreaking achievement in open-world gaming. The game introduced players to the sprawling and meticulously designed city of Los Santos  where they could assume the roles of three distinct protagonists: Michael  Franklin  and Trevor. The engaging storyline  combined with the ability to freely explore the vast open world  created an immersive experience like no other.  Heists and Beyond: In 2015  the Heists Update brought a major evolution to GTA V's multiplayer mode. Players could now plan and execute elaborate heists alongside their friends  emphasizing teamwork and strategic planning. This addition breathed new life into the game  offering thrilling cooperative experiences and further expanding the already immense gameplay possibilities.  Explosive Stunts and Thrilling Races: The Cunning Stunts Update  introduced in 2016  took the adrenaline-fueled gameplay of GTA V to new heights. Players could now engage in high-speed races and death-defying stunts  challenging their skills and pushing the boundaries of what was possible within the game's mechanics.

Players were introduced to the sprawling private island of Cayo Perico  offering a vast new location outside of Los Santos. This update not only expanded the game's narrative and heist mechanics but also introduced a wealth of new missions  challenges  and opportunities for exploration.  Conclusion: GTA V has evolved and expanded year after year  cementing its status as a revolutionary open-world masterpiece. From its early days of captivating storytelling and vast open-world exploration to the introduction of cooperative heists  explosive stunts  and the addition of new locations and missions  the game has constantly pushed the boundaries of what can be achieved in an open-world setting.

140380498,578080,76561198208375280,69389,0,Unfortunately  the San Andreas Mercenaries update made me feel very unhappy and let down. The loss of 180 cars  which drastically reduced the game's variety and enjoyment  was one of its most significant failures. The overall gaming experience has suffered as a result of this choice.  It is disappointing that there was no attempt made to improve the players' ability to use the in-game websites efficiently. The difficulties are exacerbated by this omission. By ignoring this crucial element  the developers missed a chance to improve the overall user experience.  In addition  the game's economics has just changed  making it all but useless. It is challenging to advance and participate in the game as intended because the balance and operation of the in-game economy have been damaged. Unfortunately  these problems have kept me from playing the game recently  as its current state has made it less appealing.  Although the game initially had its advantages  I now have a hard time recommending it. In the end  the game has become a poor experience as a result of the loss of many cars and the detrimental effects on the economy. Observing a once-promising game degrade so drastically is depressing.,ENG

140127205,578080,76561198401903869,23107,0,As an avid player and longtime fan of GTA this hurts  the game undoubtedly offers an immersive open-world experience  I can't help but feel dismayed by the sheer number of vehicles that have been locked behind paywalls. This decision seems to prioritize monetization over the enjoyment of the players  leaving a bitter taste in the mouths of players like myself.  A staggering number of cars  motorcycles  planes  and other vehicles were made only accessible through a paid subscription. It felt like a slap in the face to realize that the game's true potential was held hostage behind a paywall  forcing players to open their wallets wide.  Those who are unwilling or unable to spend extra money on in-game purchases find themselves at a disadvantage  unable to access the same level of content as their paying counterparts. This creates an unfair imbalance and fosters a sense of exclusion among players  ultimately damaging the overall gaming experience.,ENG
140260597,578080,76561198091138793,10732,7,"Removed nearly 200 vehicles from online mode due to ""too much clutter""and ""lesser used"" in the vehicle car shops  some bikes too. Basic stuff from a decade ago with prices like the old days. Gone. Some of the communities favorite cars  and a few that were quite popular. Removing content is awful  either leave it or don't include it and have it time out and disappear because of a license expiring or some poor taste that is offensive down the road. Online mode sucks anyways with the cheaters and script kiddies using menus. Cheating in and out of missions. Auto ending missions/heists with 150%+ payout for each player (as in 25% for each player max 100% total). How about teleporting you to some random players apartment who craves socialization. Races are some moron flying around the track at obviously manipulated speeds. GTA6 is not looking good.",ENG
140352492,578080,76561198218189565,26215,650,"PREDATORY BUSINESS. I love this game from the bottom of my heart and have played for almost a decade with thousands of hours across consoles so it aches me to say this  BUT. They have just published an update that removed almost 200 vehicles worth of content from the game for NO reason  it was thinly veiled under an attempt to ""better the browsing experience"" however no changes to the browsing experience were made at all. Still no search bar  still no filter by alphabet or vehicle class  nothing. The sad truth is likely they simply wanted to remove cheaper  older  vehicles to encourage purchasing of in game currency or to bring them back in a ""special"" manner where they can drip feed to create artificial demand/increase old prices  again  potentially costing players more. Even worse is they could be added to the GTA+ subscription thing (for consoles) which is disgusting and slightly pay to win in itself considering 'HSW'. This is UNACCEPTABLE  PREDATORY TOWARDS THEIR OWN FAN BASE and downright ATROCIOUS behaviour from a game company.

This is disgusting. The latest update  San Andreas Mercenaries  it`s 6 missions  I did them all in like 2-3 hours  and it`s done.

140042575,578080,76561198169934301,4030,0,TLDR; Good game ruined by Rockstar's incessant need for money.   The latest update removed the ability to purchase almost 200 cars in the online mode (many of which are in the base game). The PC version of the game now does not receive updates the next gen version of the game does  such as new cars and a mod shop. These additional features would be completely applicable to PC without a decrease in performance. Luckily this also means the 'GTA +' subscription model has not made it to PC.   With each GTA online update is is clear Rockstar do not cater to the player's experience anymore and instead are focussed on maximising their income before the next game.  I play the game on steam deck and the latest update has made it unplayable. The game now instantly crashes on start and there are no fixes for this as of writing. This is a issue that has occurred on previous updates.   I would recommend the game for the single player experience but I would strongly recommend against getting warped into online as you will quickly recognise Rockstar's business model and how it constrains the player's experience.,ENG

I have tried not to be biased but it is still a disappointing and frustrating experience compared to previous games in the series. Don't get me wrong  it's a good game  but I expect much more from Rockstar Games  it's very overhyped and has many glaring issues. However  it is still worth playing at least once.  Pros: - Great optimisation; - Awesome driving mechanics; - Amazing voice acting; - Lots of different customisations; - First person view; - Good soundtrack; - Plenty of satire and dark humour; - Immersive world; - Great visuals; - Good shooting mechanics; - Awesome level of detail; - Light RPG elements; - Some interesting missions; - Great animations; - Good controls;  Cons: - Boring radio; - Too linear mission design; - Weak ending; - Illogical  unlikable and frustrating main characters; - Not enough heists; - Too much shock humour; - Weak and forgettable antagonists; - Not enough interiors; - Disjointed and convoluted story due to 3 playable characters; - Game is far too easy; - Not enough content in the single player campaign; - Rockstar Games launcher;,ENG

Some base game cars/early DLC cars get left in the dust  and ultimately they clutter up in-game websites.  Now  what would you do if you had to clean up the in-game websites?  Would you:  A. Create a new website for the base game/early DLC cars?  B. Add all of the early cars to the spawn pool so they can spawn in the world  and remove them from the websites? Allowing players to pluck them off the streets if they want them?  C. Remove almost 200 base game/early DLC vehicles from the websites  and basically make some cares IMPOSSIBLE to get on PC?  Guess what options Rockstar went with. (It was C.)  This is a blatant cash-grab move from Rockstar to add these cars behind a paywall later on.   This  along with YEARS of not updating the in-game economy makes GTA Online as grindy as modern MMORPG games.   Plus  if this is how GTA Online turns out  that means GTA Online 2 (or whatever it will be with GTA 6) will be just as bad.  I can't see myself playing GTA 6  not even the story mode.

With GTA online their greed truly awoke  and since then we have only seen games in decline where cheaters run rampant in every session  everything is a shark card or gta+ marketing scheme and the only bugs being fixed are the ones that seemingly only affect microtransactions. The GTA 5 story mode was great but was completely abandoned from the get-go post release  GTA online has been receiving updates in steadily declining quality  with most new updates introducing new bugs making large swathes of the online experience genuinely unplayable. I used to play this game a lot  however the recent removal of ~200 cars to cause entirely artificial FOMO and promote GTA+ subscription profit was the very last nail in the coffin for me  I do not recommend the game and if you are a person who doesn't support increasingly vile and greedy schemes to drain your wallet for the least amount of effort possible from soulless companies who show a total lack of respect for the regular player  you should not entertain buying this game or any other games by this publisher & developer. ,ENG

After almost 10 years of online play plagued with script kiddies  with an egregiously inflated online economy (while shark cards became more-and-more of a ripoff)  Rockstar's actions in this most recent update prove they don't care about the PC community.

I kindly wish to raise your awareness to people trying to cheat you out of your steam points: The following comment is copy and paste from a lot of reviews on steam. People do that to trick you into giving you steam points (the steam currency) by posting something to appeal to your human compassionate aspect thereby ripping you off because it is all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  lies and deceipt.  ""I am a 52 year old father  probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son  who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week  he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me  as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son  as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game  did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything  and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.""",ENG

138159254,578080,76561198161045983,7670,0,Left 4 Dead 2 is genius in the way that it puts true teamplay above overpowering players like you see in various other multiplayer titles. The special infected act as a handicap for the player  which creates a real sense of dependency: you must rely on your teammates to help you out in any predicament. The friendly fire strongly encourages players to place their shots carefully and to not mindlessly play the game.  Level design is top notch with incredible environmental storytelling  pretty open spaces  and the survival horror elements provide incentive for exploration. The physical interactivity of the environment makes any encounter with infected visually impressive and satisfying.   The lack of skill trees  progression  etc. makes Left 4 Dead 2 incredibly timeless  as you can hop back into the game ten years from now and play at no disadvantage to other players. The skills and strategies you learn will stay with you by the time you return to the game in ten years. Simplicity is a strength of Left 4 Dead 2's gameplay.   The pacing of the action is expertly done  allowing the players to enjoy moments of respite after a sudden horde. The game knows how to keep the moment to moment gameplay from feeling repetitive. The moments of respite also serve as opportunities for exploration  which is great. A multiplayer game that balances the action and the exploration is simply fantastic. The game is at its best when the audio cues suggest to the players that a horde is coming  and everyone scrambles to find a spot to hold up in and prepare for the onslaught  building tension as players await their possible demise.,ENG

Add the onions  garlic and carrot. Cook for 5-7 mins over a medium heat until softened. Turn up the heat a little and stir in the tomato purée. Cook for 1 min  pour in the white wine  then cook for 5 mins until this has reduced by two-thirds. Pour over the chopped tomatoes and add the basil leaves. Bring to the boil then simmer for 20 mins. Leave to cool then whizz in a food processor. Will keep  cooled  in the fridge for up to three days or frozen for three months.  STEP 2 To make the white sauce  melt the butter in a saucepan  stir in the plain flour  then cook for 2 mins. Slowly whisk in the milk  then bring to the boil  stirring. Turn down the heat  then cook until the sauce starts to thicken and coats the back of a wooden spoon. Will keep  cooled  in the fridge for up to three days or frozen for three months.  STEP 3 Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Lightly oil two large baking trays and add the peppers and aubergines. Toss with the olive oil  season well  then roast for 25 mins until lightly browned.  STEP 4 Reduce the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Lightly oil a 30 x 20cm ovenproof dish. Arrange a layer of the vegetables on the bottom  then pour over a third of the tomato sauce. Top with a layer of lasagne sheets  then drizzle over a quarter of the white sauce. Repeat until you have three layers of pasta.  STEP 5 Spoon the remaining white sauce over the pasta  making sure the whole surface is covered  then scatter over the mozzarella and cherry tomatoes. Bake for 45 mins until bubbling and golden.,ENG

137334082,578080,76561198967888189,4726,0,The principle is simple  but perfectly functional. A team of four cooperates against hordes of infected. Basic zombies aren't dangerous in themselves  but they make up for this handicap with numbers. Far more dangerous are more capable individuals  who tend to jump on players  throw up  or attract them with their tongue several meters long.  It is in the cooperation of the players that the main strength lies. It pays to stick together and help each other when needed. That includes the situation where your species is rolling on the ground and has a few last moments left before it dies completely. That's when you should rush to the rescue and lift him  at least temporarily  to his feet. Other types of team solidarity include healing allies or passing out pain pills that temporarily increase health.  As unbelievable as it sounds  in conjunction with the quality game modes  this system has ensured tremendous playability. The first episode already showed it  and the sequel is no exception. The frenetic and sometimes dull action will serve as a great release  and on the other hand  as more serious entertainment. [b] 20% [/b],ENG

138619610,578080,76561198203411984,4651,0,"I am a 50 year old human male  probably one of the oldest and most boring people playing this game. I am a father to my 15 children  ranging from ages 3 to 40. My 37 year old son recently started Left 4 Dead 2 and in less than a week  he had already played for over 200 hours. This was amazing for me  as it was already hard enough for me to avoid spending time with my insufferable offspring. All they care for these days is recording them TikTok dances  collecting Funko Pops and scrolling Instagram.  Inspired by seeing him having a reason to stop coming out of the basement to ask for more junk food  I decided to try it myself. I loaded into the game  smashed some buttons but I was stuck on what I was supposed to do. I asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. As soon as we loaded in  he immediately started shouting unintelligible commands at me through his rainbow flashing headset like ""CAMP THE SPAWN!"" and ""POP SOME PILLS AND MOLLY THAT TANK!"" Every time I messed up  which was always  he would call me names like noob and filthy casual.  The horde of zombies descending upon our characters was reminiscent of the swarm of children I had unwittingly spawned into this world. I have never felt more confused and upset in my decades of fatherhood. This was the worst time I had spent with my son since his mother had that mid-life crisis.  This game has ever since driven my son and I apart again and now we actually spend even less time together. This game reminded me that there's misery to be had in everything  and it has brought me many traumatic memories of my failed attempts at fatherhood.",ENG

140869281,578080,76561198061330554,12762,327,Sadly for the us ( the player base ) L4D2 is still the best CO-OP Zombie FPS ever  even after almost 15 years.  This shows two things :  - L4D2 was so ahead of it's time  designed to perfection - with great formula and combination of satisfying and rewarding gameplay. Playable to this day.  and  - A game that is 15 years old to still be the best in its genre means sadly that other game developers are not even trying to make a good game like L4D2  everything is only about how much devs can juice out of their product. No one actually cares about quality of the game or its replayability.   2008 was a year and period without micro transactions  DLCs  etc. That is what makes this game special to this day.,ENG

30219144,578080,76561198202929950,20436,0,Unturned is phenomenal game. The fact that this game has been developed by a 16 year old astonishes me. The aesthetics suit the game. Yes  the graphics are not great. However  I think  it should stay like this. It gives the game an identity. When I first played the game  I was not expecting much. I wasn't expecting a full on tactical rpg  or a racing game  or a base build survival co op  or a PVP open world deathmatch. I wasn't expecting any of these. Yet  it offered all of this. Survival is very rewarding. However  be warned  your stuff can vanish depending on the server. Dont get too attached to your items. Sandbox servers are the best as they allow you to do anything you want.  Unturned is a blast  you can really do anything. However  the community can be very toxic sometimes. Depending on how you look at it. In conclusion: The game does no other triple A game has done. H1Z1 and DayZ don't feel that friendly. Unturned feels friendly to new comers. Just bring a friend and scavenge the post apocalyptic environment.  Surprisingly there is lore in the world of Unturned. I'll leave you to discover the hidden lore.  ,ENG
121551628,578080,76561198307026057,1211,0,I am a 43 year old father  probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son  who is now 12. My son recently started Unturned and in less than a week  he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me  as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son  as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game  made my character and world and started playing  but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything  and it has brought both my son and I many happy memories.,ENG

A once brilliant game that has ironically fallen to the greed driven  poorly thought through changes made by the developers as they attempt to cater to  and milk  the increasingly intolerable prepubescent community on which Unturned is built.    Unturned has become a stale  filtered  dull  lifeless shadow of it's former self. A game plagued by unneccessary 'novelty updates' sourced from the devs' chronic fear of their audience losing interest.  The game has taken a steep turn away from competetive survival PvP that characterised it in it's early days  with each new update over the last year (2016) serving only to remove another quality of Unturned that I'd grown to love in the past. I've spent a thousand hours enjoying one key element of Unturned that I've always felt was most defiining of it  the 'Spawn  Gear  Die  Rush' sequence. Essentially  you spawn fresh into a server  you find gear to personalise yourself and weaponary  you get killed by another player  and a state of panic ensues as you desperately attempt to regain your hard earned gear that has taken you so long to ecumulate. This sequence  though frustrating  was what made Unturned thrilling  giving players a constant state of fear of attack as they interacted with the map and other players. Yet the devs have removed this sequence  and all forms of gameplay that it complimented  because it is less appealing to the dominant demographic of children.   I suppose you think I'm salty. Well... I am. I enjoyed Unturned  as much as I have any other game  but it's been distorted beyond recognition from the game which I  and many others  loved years ago. Don't waste your time on it.",ENG

This game has an amazing community  actually  one of the BEST communities in a survival game. Yeah the kids can be annoying and will absolutely destroy your eardrums  but all of that can be settled down by looking at how basic  yet beautiful this game is. To whoever wants to try this game  by all means do it!,ENG

29869670,578080,76561198122303682,40768,0,"[b] WARNING: this is a very long review  so grab something to drink or eat while reading :)[/b]  OK  this is an angry review of the game and gonna be 100% honest. The game  is good it really is  I mean the fact that this was developped by a 16 year old is amazing. however  it still has lots of bugs here and there but I'm okay with as long as it doesn't affect the gameplay. here's a small little shitty review made by someone who has nothing else to do but this review  enjoy :) [h1] Awesome things about the game :	[/h1] - gathering loot  guns (lots of them!)  medical supplies and building supplies takes time and I personaly like that. - a vast amount of vehicles - really good maps.  - game constantly gets updated with more stuff! - awesome modding community.   This is why I gave the review a thumbs up   [b] HOWEVER	[/b]   if you're looking for a game where you can just team up with strangers and communicate with enemies before fighting or to trade  Then I don't recommend this game at all and this  is why I'm not playing any more  the community is bad. Servers are filled with people who just don't give a fuck and shoot you on sight without asking if you're friendly or not  they take all your loot  making the time you took to gather all the loot worthless. If you happen to kill them they would follow to get their loot back at all cost and just ruin the game for you (I'm speaking of experience here  it might differ for you). If you ever do manage to team up with strangers they would find a way to backstab you  the moment you least expect it (still talking from experience).   [b] time for a little story:	[/b]   I was playing with my cousin and we found a really friendly group that we teamed up with  we became an actual working group and all then we found another dude who befriended us for few days  he helped us build a base  fight bandits and we trusted him  until one day we were at a campground and he told us he a had a friend waiting for him. He told us to regroup and to holster our guns  I started to doubt something and started backing off  he said ""what i wanna tell you is..."" him and his friend start shooting us  I was the first one to die because I pulled out my gun. no one from my real group survived and they took our loot.  You could find people you can trust but you won't find a lot. Since most of the players are preteen kids  they will just shoot you and piss you off if you happen to kill them. Not to mention some servers are just abused by admins  admins who are kids and would ban you for attacking them and use god mode. One trick people use as well is remove the grass so that they can see you a mile away and would ruin your effect of surprise. I find that so annoying.  And last but not least  hackers  but that's old news with BattleEye working with Unturned.   All in all  it's a survival game  so I expected to kill  and to be killed but I love cooperating with survivors. Unfortunately  most of them would kill me for my loot  there's 0 cooperation if you don't play with friends.  If you're like me and likes to be as realistic as possible  if you want to communicate with other groups  to wage war or make peace and to trade  this is not a game for you. It became a game where only the simple rule is to ""kill all"". The game has potential  but sadly the community ruined the game for me.  Thanks for reading this long review  and have a nice day.",ENG

29610722,578080,76561198136590025,67461,0,I think you can say I've played this game for quite a bit with over 1050 hours of gameplay  so you might be asking why am I righting a negative report? Back in Unturned 2.0 when this game first came out  it was not the only multiplayer open world apocalyptic survival game out there  but it was different from DayZ and H1Z1. Unturned wasn't a hobby it was a lifestyle  I know it sounds crazy but there would be these crazy vibes like getting up on a cold december morning on a snowday and skipping breakfast to just play unturned with all your friends. But later as the game developed on it turned into more of a game like DayZ and H1Z1  I think that the developer is doing a great job with his game despite being a student in school. But only recently I think that this game has taken a turn. First off you can't be very creative  building bases is boring  if you take a game like minecraft  you can do anything to hide a base because you could build secret trap doors and cool little things like that. Also Unturned is getting very repititve. The whole sequence of a unturned pvp server is: 1) Build a base 2) Get raided No longer is it a challenge to raid bases when you could simply shoot the door with a LMG. Also the shooting and the action of this game has turned into something like BLOCKADE 3D. If you load our your skills theres no recoil on almost 75% of all full-auto guns  also adding to the third person aspect with people complaining about popshotters and stuff. Speaking of people complaining  the community is very toxic and hostile  everybody gets pissed when someone raids ther sh!t-shack on top of a hill. Thats all I have to say about this game  it has turned from a great idea in the past to a game that you'll play when theres nothing else to do on a boring saturday.  Final notes: Don't get me wrong  I love this game and the idea of it I've made so many friends in this game and some that I've even met with in real life The platform it runs on is perfect for your dad's laptop that you play on while he's not working Lastly  Nelson Sexton the developer is a very bright kid  I love what he's done and I hope he continues what he's doing  instead I think he should listen to the community a bit more  I know his email is spammed with a bunch of 12 year olds but he needs to solve a problem here and find a way to fufill what the audiance wants.  And for all of those who know me  Love your good old squeaker  Pinecone.,ENG

30087704,578080,76561198064963668,7648,0,So let me start off with this: Its FREE!   I mean its a free game and also developped by one guy. Why wouldn't I recommend it?  The combat system is smooth and the lvl up system is not bad  one thing that I recal that isn't good is that the stuff dosen't respawn unless you quit and come back (Note I don't know if he did fix this or not). You can also play with you're friends which makes the game even better and build a fort!  It has a workshop  so if you're bored of the same small map over and over you can always get different map made by the community and some of them are really amazing.   Overall I recommend it to those who love Zombie/Survival games. Just try it  its not gonna hurt,ENG

29474311,578080,76561198156520233,10838,0,So  one of my only reviews  but I figured since I've been playing this game practically since it came out I thought I would give it a try. Unturned is a post-apocalyptic FPS which takes place in a number of maps  e.g. PEI (Canada)  Washington (US)  Yukon (Canada)  and Russia.. (Russia :P)  and hundreds of others that can be downloaded from the Steam: Workshop. This game should be played (in my opinion) with multiple friends  although it is still fairly fun on your own Campaign map. I would say that Unturned is one of  or the best F2P on Steam  and if you like it enough  you can pay small fee of $5 for cosmetics and crap. So  now I'll take a look at the Pros  and Cons..   Pros: The game gets updated almost every week or so it seems (sometime faster) It's... free The PvP aspect is hyper-realistic Zombies are cool Simplistic graphics  and easy to run   Cons: There are none  from my perspective   Overall  I would say I definitely recommend this game to all kinds of gamers  whether you're Casual  Hardcore  or just don't know how to play games... ,ENG

""if you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate. you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exacly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me - ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through"". I agreed. At 27  i have never touched a cigarette. I must say. I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it  because this game gave me cancer anyway.",ENG

111966089,578080,76561198799418942,182790,0,Based on Singleplayer  Multiplayer and Community  (Christmas of 2017-Mid 2021 Gameplay  Review)  Singleplayer is not very good.  You can sub to any mods you want  spawn anything you want  but in general having a server is just better for testing.  Unturned lore is not intersting to even play singleplayer like a story game  its just bland.  Its fun at first and gets boring at around 20 hours.  (2/10)   Multiplayer is amazing  this is where you will put all your hours.  Yes  Unturned singleplayer might be a ton of fun at first  and I do remeber the feeling.  But multiplayer is just better.  You can play vanilla servers  workshop servers  modded servers  semi rp servers or rp servers.  You can rack up 1000s and still have fun.  (10/10)  The community  well for me that's a mixed one.  The stuff the community produces  the maps and mods are astonishing and impressive  very cool stuff.  Its just how they act and are  that is annoying to me.  I have met some people I like and I play with them  but I dislike the majority.   Most admins/owners on servers that actively play are abusive.  They spawn loot in alot of times and won't play like a normal player.  Also freedom of speech is VERY limited in this community  admins/owners have massive egos and will perm ban you if they don't like what you said.  You see  some of these servers have rules.  But most admins don't understand the rules  so if you did something they didn't like  and its not aganist the rules  they can ban you anyways.  Like I said  this is just the majority but its very annoying regardless even if some admins and owners aren't like this.  Many admins/owners lack competence  they are stupid.  RP SUCKS ESPECIALLY.  (4/10)  Overall from that time period the game is a 8/10  its the most fun I ever had in gaming asides Fallout 4  and some old Nintendo games I used to play.    Lets talk about Late 2021 to present day Unturned.  Unless you have a big group of friends who still play  this game is not that fun anymore.  Singleplayer and Community is still the same  but Multiplayer is not.  There lacks a variety of fun servers  even servers to just mess around on.  No variety  there pretty much all similar.  I would give multiplayer a 3/10 now.  Unturned as of today is a 3/10 to me  its gotten worse over that period of time.  Do I reccomend it?  Yes  for a noobie its fun but it gets boring quick now.    2023 Update: Game still sucks and instead of adding cool things to the game  they add stupid call of duty hitmarkers and lbgt nonsense. This game is a survival game turned boring pvp cod shooter kit command game.      ,ENG
29876252,578080,76561198068842004,10195,0,best game i've played  first time i downloaded it me and my friends we spent like 30 hours straight on it and we didn't even take a break. Hours pass so fast in this game  there's so many mods you can play. I remember once we went on a server and we gathered resources and build a house  next day the house didn't save so we did everything again..and it didn't save again xD but we didn't get bored of doing the same thing over and over again because you can get creative in so many ways especially in pvp servers :D quality game 11/10,ENG

139721761,578080,76561199093458493,36996,0,After 600 hours of rust  I gained 78 pounds  lost roughly 5 thousand dollars to rust skins and my family no longer talks to me. My wife left me and I can no longer talk/see my kids :( I like to see the bright side of it  I have no nagging wife and annoying kids to distract me from my grind  I can really get out there and give it my all. I have found that my alcohol addiction has calmed down (not really) along with the beer bottles being broken on the floor from me absolutely dogging on my children after dying to a 11 year old racist door camper that calls me sh*t at the game. I could keep going about how rust made my life great but I wont  for now.  #RustLife! 10/10 would recommend!!!!,ENG

I decided to joinmy first zerg aka ""SMG' after joing this clan i was forced to play wipes other wise my roles were removed i would be punished for not playing on wipeday they wouuld call me a leech. I spent a few wipes only farming sulfer to not go on a single raid and the ones i went on insta fail raid. One wipe i did inside SMG but not really. I also fell victim to bandicamp.com and threw my life saving away watching a streamer do it for free. Im broke sad mad angry on the edge. After today i uninstalled the game the only way i would ever reccomend this game is if u truly do not value ur time on this earth. u will be sucked and u wont ever ever ever be able to quit this game. Highly addicitive and stress.  since playing rust ive gained high blood pressure issues cant spell properlee. and no longer have any real life freinds. my clan has failed me. my leader failed me. but at the end of the day it is night. and i dont think i will ever play rust again. i also lost my duo bite two  4 months ago because he was mad i played with smg now i never will see him again on moose med",ENG

140357298,578080,76561199124069634,115115,1879,Do you ever feel useless  like you don't matter? Do you feel like anything you accomplish is pointless and leads to nothing? Well congratulations you found the perfect game for yourself. Spawn on the beaches of Normandy and get gunned down instantly. Maybe spawn in a desert and get bashed in the head by a rock. Perhaps spawn in the North Pole and get eaten by a fat fucking polar bear. When you eventually pick a nice spot to start building your shitty honeycomb base made out of the finest wood  make your way to the open roads so you can destroy some barrels and get some silly little scrap and some low grade fuel. Maybe even pick up the green card at the gas station as well. That's the only time you are progressing in this game  any other time you are either killed and called racist slurs or have your entire base leveled by mystical little rocket fairies that take your things. This game has made me and my whole friend group spend countless hours to mauled in the very end to the point of blind rage. I have pooped blood because of the sheer speed of the stool coming out of my butt cheeks because I am so infuriated. The graphics are great if you want your PC to explode in your face causing third degree burns. The animations are also nice if you are into games that makes your character look like they have lost control of basic motor skills. You cant even change your characters appearance so I look as disappointing in game as I do in real life.,ENG
140338384,578080,76561198080771233,7756,0,[h1]Rust Review[/h1] Rust  developed by Facepunch Studios  is a highly challenging multiplayer survival game set in a post-apocalyptic world. Known for its ruthless player interactions  intense PvP combat  and a robust base-building system  Rust has gained significant popularity since its early access release. This in-depth review will evaluate the game's core mechanics  progression system  community dynamics  graphics  and overall state to provide an accurate assessment of Rust in its current form.  [h1]Harsh Survival Mechanics[/h1] Rust's survival mechanics are unforgiving and demand constant attention. Players must contend with hunger  thirst  temperature  and radiation while scavenging for resources and crafting essential items. The game's emphasis on survival creates a tense and immersive atmosphere  where every decision counts. From hunting animals for food to managing your base's defenses  Rust keeps players on their toes and encourages strategic planning to endure the harsh environment.  [h1]Base Building and Progression[/h1] Rust's base-building system is a standout feature  offering players a vast range of creative possibilities. From small shelters to sprawling fortresses  players can construct elaborate structures using various building materials. The ability to reinforce bases with traps and defensive measures adds an extra layer of complexity to gameplay. The progression system  which involves unlocking new blueprints and crafting better gear  provides a sense of accomplishment and motivates players to explore the world and engage in conflicts to secure valuable resources.  [h1]Player Interactions and PvP Combat[/h1] Rust is notorious for its cutthroat player interactions  where trust is scarce  and alliances can be shattered in an instant. The game's open-world nature encourages both cooperation and conflict among players. Whether teaming up to form powerful factions or engaging in intense firefights  Rust's PvP combat is brutal and exhilarating. The high stakes and the constant threat of losing everything add a palpable tension to every encounter  making each interaction a thrilling and unpredictable experience.  [h1]Dynamic Community and Social Aspects[/h1] Rust's community dynamics contribute significantly to its gameplay experience. Servers are populated by diverse groups of players  ranging from friendly collaborators to ruthless bandits. The emergence of player-controlled factions and complex social hierarchies adds depth to the game's social interactions. The ability to trade  form alliances  and wage wars with other players fosters a dynamic and evolving ecosystem that keeps the game world alive and engaging.  [h1]Visuals and Sound Design[/h1] Rust's visuals create a stark and atmospheric post-apocalyptic setting. The game's environments  ranging from lush forests to desolate wastelands  are beautifully rendered and provide an immersive backdrop for the survival experience. However  it's worth noting that the game's graphics can vary depending on hardware capabilities and server settings.  The sound design in Rust is equally impressive  with ambient sounds  gunshots  and environmental effects adding depth to the gameplay. The use of positional audio enhances the immersive nature of the game  allowing players to locate nearby threats and react accordingly.  [h1]Conclusion[/h1] Rust  in its current state  remains a unique and challenging multiplayer survival game. Its unforgiving survival mechanics  deep base-building system  intense PvP combat  and dynamic player interactions create a highly engaging and unpredictable experience. The game's evolving community dynamics and the visual and sound design further contribute to its immersive nature. However  Rust's brutal and often hostile environment may not be suitable for players seeking a more relaxed or cooperative gameplay experience. For those seeking a true test of survival instincts and a relentless multiplayer sandbox  Rust offers a thrilling and unforgettable journey in a harsh post-apocalyptic world.,ENG

140045262,578080,76561198271709335,29539,0,Quite possibly the best MMO survival game that you can find  the game looks and runs great with no issues (unless you're on a bad server of-course)  Game-play revolves around building up a base  killing some players  dying a lot and losing all your gear as well as getting raided every other time you log off the server. That's why the best way of playing is to get a good week's time and just try-hard through that week. You'll probably have a good bit of fun and then just don't play the game for a few weeks.   I'd say if you can get 2 or so extra players it would be a lot more fun  but playing solo isn't too bad either (if you can get along with your neighbours) Overall a great experience and many hours of fun to be had  the pricing of the game isn't too bad either  especially if you can get it on sale.  ,ENG

140956434,578080,76561199419176622,374,374,So I started playing 'Rust' at 4pm yesterday.  Within 3 minutes of my first time playing  a bear ate me. Then I watched two other players club each other to death with large stones  while completely naked  penises (penii?) dangling in the wind. Having managed to slay a small pig  I fashioned some clothes to cover my genitals  then went exploring.  Ate some uncooked meat and threw up all over the place. Made a small fire to cook the rest of my meat. Fashioned a bow and arrow out of some wood I collected  also a shirt and a pair of boots. Went about fashioning a small shelter out of some random crap laying around so I wouldn't have to sleep outdoors. I could have chosen from one of the many  many  ramshackle structures dotting the landscape. But those may or may not belong to/contain other players. Who may or may not be armed or clothed. I just wanted to peacefully live alone  so I stuck to the wilderness.  I slipped off a cliff and broke both my legs. I shouted out to anyone who would listen  asking what to do to fix my broken legs  I didn't understand the game and I needed help. A naked man came over  typed '??? i help' in response to my pleas  then bashed my head in with a rock and presumably looted my corpse.  Then I starved to death when I forgot to eat. Out of desperation I butchered a wolf that attacked me instead of running away  but didnt have time to cook so I ate raw meat again. Nope. Instead of just starving to death  I vomited  then starved to death.  Its now 7:25 am and many adventures later  I've decided to sleep in a small shack I made myself in the mountains. Don't dare risk making a fire  someone might see it at night and kill me for the tin of baked beans I got off a zombie I found wandering around a town that gave me radiation poisoning. Oh yeah  I'll probably die slowly because of the radiation  but thats a problem for later-me.  In a tiny hut on a mountain with my sleeping bag and meager belongings after 12 hours of playing straight  I can probably safely say I'm enjoying this game.,ENG

140851805,578080,76561198805567522,64578,11995,This game has ruined my life. Never have I felt more isolated from my friends then at this moment where it's my peak playtime. I feel so alone  with nobody speak to other than the farm bot nerd no lives that are in my Discord call. You can never quit  even the thought of getting offlined brings me fear  I can't log off without the fear of my juicy fat bags from oil being grubbed by some 32 deep zerg. My life has fallen apart by how deep I am into this game  however I cannot stop. Whenever I feel down  I grab my boogie board and eoka  book it to oil. And I don't stop until I find myself beaming mini's trying to counter from 300 meters. In reality this game costs more than 40 dollars. The amount of money that you will get pulled into spending on skins and DLC's is concerning. Sometimes I even consider buying the Rust music pack so I can listen to it on the Steam music player while I am waiting for crate timer on oil. When I'm off the game (which is very rare) I don't stop thinking about it  whenever I have to fulfill curse that is sleeping. I dream about me taking cargo and oil. After I wake up I make my dreams a reality. If you have currently have empathy and trust in people  don't expect that to stay intact when you play this game. All trust and empathy you have for people completely vanishes when you press the launch button on Steam. If you get offended easily  don't play this game  the most common type of people in this game are the people who scream racial slurs at the top of their lungs  after a while you become immune to it. Please send help  my life has gone down a dark hole ever since I discovered this game. If I don't make a change soon  I fear that there will be no escape for this never ending cycle of isolation. My family has lost hope in trying to recover me from this game. If you want to keep your sanity  your health  and your life  then avoid this game. If you like your monitor without a giant hole punched through it  please stay away from this game. I might too far gone.   Important Notes:  2x2's are life and only farmbot nerds learn how to build. Oil is love  oil is life. It is my home. I provide for oil  oil provides for me. 2x is peak  I like progressing slowly but vanilla makes me feel like an old man trying to reach for his meds. Don't let your friend inside you or let him hold the C4 and accidentally throw it  and then let him try to make it up to by farming. (This person knows who they are)  Please send help.,ENG

You will love this game and it's devs in the end  it's a journey that can never truly be told by another person  it's something that you have to venture and learn by yourself.

140786245,578080,76561198235573976,13106,0,Rust is an incredibly engaging game that offers a unique and challenging gameplay experience. With its own set of mechanics and tactics  it presents a learning curve for new players. The game's major downside is the necessity of forming teams to fully enjoy it. While you can ask others in the server to join your team  it's best to play with companions  starting from a simple duo up to eight players in official servers  where the competition is fierce due to players dedicating countless hours each day throughout the wipe cycles (weekly  biweekly  monthly).  Rust boasts impressive graphics that enhance the immersive atmosphere. For those who prefer a less intense PvP experience  there are PvE and Zombie servers available where base raiding is not permitted. However  one drawback of the game is the presence of paid skins  which can come at high prices due to the Steam market's influence. These skins offer advantages such as camouflage in various environments like forests  deserts  and more.  Rust is a visually appealing and challenging survival game with its own distinct mechanics and tactics. While forming a team can be essential for a fulfilling experience  the game provides various server options to cater to different playstyles. With its immersive gameplay and a strong emphasis on survival  Rust offers an addictive and rewarding experience for players who are willing to invest the time and effort.,ENG

I dont recommend this game. If your a new player just trying to figure things out do a pve server. I tried official and I couldn't even get off the beach. I think I waited for like 10 min to get in a server and then i spawned and died. The only game where every single person targets a naked. I even had a tank blow me up as a naked  screw this game. Wont try it again and wish I could return it.,ENG
